              RAINY WEATHER


In the skies, the clouds gather and twist,
A stormy rain begins to insist,
The thunder booms and the lightning flashes bright,
A beautiful sight, a wondrous sight.

The raindrops fall like diamonds from above,
A deluge of water, a true wonder of love,
The puddles shimmer and glimmer with grace,
A reflection of the storm's embrace.

The thunder rolls and the lightning gleams,
A celestial show, a cosmic dream,
The rain dances on the rooftops and streets,
A symphony of sound, a treat for the feet.

The world is fresh and clean and new,
A rain-washed beauty, pure and true,
The storm may rage, but it's all right,
For in the rain, there's a beauty in sight.
