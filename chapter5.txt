# It was the time of sunshine, It was the time of rain


In days of sunshine, the world was bright,
With skies of blue and clouds so light.
The warmth on skin, a joyous sight,
Bringing laughter, love, and delight.

But then the rains came, oh so sudden,
And washed away the sun's sweet token.
The skies grew grey, the thunder boomed,
And lightning flashed, the winds assumed.

The world was drenched, the streets were wet,
And all around, a symphony bet.
The raindrops danced, the puddles shone,
A kaleidoscope of colors shown.

The sun and rain, a perfect blend,
A tale of contrast, a true friend.
For in the rain, the world is new,
And in the sun, the heart is true.

So let the rains fall, let the sun shine,
For in their dance, we find our design.
A balance of light and dark, you see,
The beauty of life, a harmony.
